Spring 2021 CSCI262 Data Structures

This project had me design a function to calculate and plot the most optimal route through various terrains based on the least change of elevation.
Starter Code was provided and I implemented the functions that calculated and plotted the routes.
One function used recursion and the other did not use recursion to speed up calculations.
